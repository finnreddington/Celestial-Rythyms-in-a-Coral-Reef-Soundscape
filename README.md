Steps to replicate the analysis in ‘Celestial Rhythms and Environmental Variables Drive Temporal Patterns in a Coral Reef Soundscape’ (2025), use the scripts (indicated in italics) following the steps below.

1. **In Python, calculate indices:**
    1. Following the analysis by Williams _et al._ (2024)
2. **In R prepare the indices and current data for analysis:**

_Prepare_indices_kimbe_island.R_

_Prepare_currentdata_kimbe_island.R_

1. **Use GAM models for high- and low- frequency sound and then plot:**

_GAM_Lfreq_M.Rmd_

_GAM_Hfreq_M.Rmd_

1. **Finally, plot the raw data:**

_Raw_Data_Plot.Rmd_
